# Enhancing Credit card fraud detection using Adversarial attacks

This project demonstrate a novel approach to modify and adapt state-of-the-art algorithms to imbalanced tabular data, in the context of credit card fraud detection and test the robustness of the machine learning algorithms when subjected to adversarial attacks

The dataset is csv file that be downloaded from the link : https://datahub.io/machine-learning/creditcard.
Out of the json and csv version available in the link, download the csv version and retain the name of the dataset file as creditcard.csv for proper loading and execution of the ipynb file.

Detailed EDA and the experimental results are provided in the Final Code.ipynb
